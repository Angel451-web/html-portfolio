<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, i'm <strong>Angel Brown</strong>, a passionate aspiring front-end developer currently
  diving into the world of HTML and CSS. Im excited to begin my journey in web development
, with a focus on building beautiful and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>I got started with web development through a mix of online resources, icluding
  a course with Colt Steele on Udemy, books and Youtube tutorials. These resources helped me build
   a solid foundation in HTML. Now, I'm further developing my skills through a bootcamp with
   Angela Yu on Udemy, where i'm deepening my understanding of frontend technologies, currently working on CSS.

</p>

<p>Though i'm still at the beginning of my career, this project marks the start of many to come
   and i am eager to continue learning and growing. I'm focused on mastering front-end development
  and excited of creating visually appealing and functional web experiences.

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy cooking, research, watching movies and singing. I believe
  that creativity and curiosity fuel both my hobbies and my passion for web development.
