<h1>The best movies according to Angel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>How the Grinch stole christmas</h3>
<p>This is my all-time favorite, especially during the holiday season. <br/> 
    I watch it almost every Chrismas, and it never fails to make me feel 
    all cozy and nostalgic. <br> There's just something heartwarming about watching 
    the Grinch's heart grow three sizes.</p>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>Its silly, funny, smart and has more heart than you'd expect. A comfort movie for sure.</p>
<h3>Bad Boys</h3>
<p>A really great action, comedy movie that never gets old.</p>
